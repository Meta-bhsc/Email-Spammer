# Email-Spammer
A personal email spammer website.

This is a website being hosted on my private server. So dont expect anything too great.

If multiple people are using the server it may get overloaded and not work, because like I said it's a personal server. All it is, is a script running with flask and then made public.

You don't need to download the batch file to run, thats optional.

The batch file is just to download so you can run the website from your desktop if you want to

### Keep in mind this may be taken down whenever. I _might_ turn it into a number message spammer in some time.
